Anthropic can technically do OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
But if we want to make it more "personalized" or fluffed
We can utilize a wrapper for google's OCR - Tesseract

pystesseract is the basic un-trained ocr 
we can train it to read certain documents better or a specific format

i develop and run things on linux cause thats just how i know it unfortunately
running should install everything required except the venv i did not want to screw any of that up currently
`bash setup.sh`
