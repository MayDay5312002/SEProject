How to Use It:

Set your Anthropic API key as an environment variable:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

Import and use the class in your code:
pythonfrom financial_analytics import FinancialAnalyticsAPI, load_purchases_from_csv

# Either load from CSV
purchases = load_purchases_from_csv("my_transactions.csv")

# Or create purchases directly
purchases = [
    {"date": "2025-04-01", "amount": 120.50, "category": "Groceries", "vendor": "Store A"},
    # More purchases...
]

client = FinancialAnalyticsAPI()

# Get analysis for different timeframes
current_month = client.get_current_month_data(purchases)
previous_month = client.get_previous_month_data(purchases)
ytd = client.get_ytd_data(purchases)


The API will return a structured analysis with category breakdowns, total spending, recommendations, and more. You can extend the code to add visualizations or integrate with other systems as needed.
